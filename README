Solve anagram from the Dinosaur Comic at qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1663, with this letter count:
    12t10o8e7a6l6n6u5i5s5d5h5y3I3r3fbbwwkcmvg

hints:
    All words in the solution are dictionary words.
    What's more, all words in the solution are in the Jadrian's awesome Qwantz Corpus!
    The solution is natural-sounding, reasonably-grammatical dialogue that T-Rex would say, using phrasing that T-Rex would use.
    The punctuation :,!! is in the solution, in that order!
    The longest word in the solution is 11 characters long.
    The second longest word contains 8 characters and is next to the 11 character word
    The solution does not refer to anagrams or puzzles or winning t-shirts.
    However, what T-Rex is saying is directly related to the content of the comic the puzzle appears in.
    The letters given are case-sensitive!
    The first word of the solution is "I".

strategy:
    Solve function takes partial solution and recursively solves rest of puzzle
    Use words from list in order of frequency
    Pre-filter word list to remove words that
        don't match the letter counts
        aren't in the dictionary
        aren't in the qwantz corpus
    Check at each step:
        Is this solution 98 characters or less total?
        Does this solution match the character count?
        If this solution has less than 11 characters left, does it contain at least one 11-character word?
        If this solution has less than 8 characters to add, does it contain at least one 8-character word?
        
    How to avoid generating each permutation of a set of words?
    Filter word collections by... ?
        Distribution of word length
        number of 2- and 3-grams
        markov-chain probability of that order of words
            not exactly- if a single 2-gram isn't already existing the result is 0 probability
