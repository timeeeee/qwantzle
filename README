Solve anagram from the Dinosaur Comic at qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1663, with this letter count:
	12t10o8e7a6l6n6u5i5s5d5h5y3I3r3fbbwwkcmvg

hints:
	All words in the solution are dictionary words.
	What's more, all words in the solution are in the Jadrian's awesome Qwantz Corpus!
	The solution is natural-sounding, reasonably-grammatical dialogue that T-Rex would say, using phrasing that T-Rex would use.
	The punctuation :,!! is in the solution, in that order!
	The longest word in the solution is 11 characters long. Update: The longest word is "fundamental"!
	The second longest word contains 8 characters and is next to the 11 character word
	The solution does not refer to anagrams or puzzles or winning t-shirts.
	However, what T-Rex is saying is directly related to the content of the comic the puzzle appears in.
	The letters given are case-sensitive!
	The first word of the solution is "I".

strategy:
	Basically: Create all possible combinations of words that fit the requirements, then permute those	
	Guess a word that fits character counts, then solve recursively for the rest of the words
	      (each recursion starts at the last word guessed so we get combinations not permutations)
	Pre-filter word list to remove words that
		don't match the letter counts
		have 9 or 10 letters
		aren't in the dictionary
		aren't in the qwantz corpus

	The only thing I need to check for at each step is, does this fit with word counts?

	evaluations
		Sort combinations by
		how well they fit expected word length distribution?
		how well they match "word choice distribution"? (better word for this?)
	Sort permutations by fuzzy grammar rating?
